## What is this book about?
Automation is critical to success in the world of DevOps. How quickly and efficiently an application deployment can be automated, or a new infrastructure can be built up, can be the difference between a successful product or a failure. Ansible provides a simple yet powerful automation engine. Beyond the basics of Ansible lie a host of advanced features which are available to help you increase efficiency and accomplish complex orchestrations with ease.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand Ansibleâ€™s code and logic flow 
* Safeguard sensitive data within Ansible 
* Access and manipulate complex variable data within Ansible playbooks 
* Handle task results to manipulate change and failure definitions 
* Organize Ansible content into a simple structure 
* Craft a multi-tier rollout playbook utilizing load balancers and manipulating your monitoring system 
* Utilize advanced Ansible features to orchestrate rolling updates with almost no service disruptions 
* Troubleshoot Ansible failures to understand and resolve issues 
* Extend Ansible with custom modules, plugins, or inventory sources
